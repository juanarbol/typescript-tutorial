# Description:

In this repo I'm gonna push some exercises of typescript, the idea of this repo is to have a cheatsheet when I need something of ts (something I've forgot could be) or for teaching to a pal who wants to know about ts.

As first I took [this tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
